* Environment details (OS / Browser / Node)
* Screenshots or logs when helpful

### Submit Code Changes

   ```bash
   # Feature
   git checkout -b feat/implement-comment-from-side-panel

   # Fix
   git checkout -b fix/fullpage-capture-height
   ```

## Branching Strategy (Guideline)

* **master**: stable branch
* **release/x.y.z**: release prep & maintenance
* Topic branches:
  * `feat/*` â€“ feature work
  * `fix/*` â€“ bug fixes
  * `chore/*` â€“ chores (deps, config, CI, etc.)
  * `docs/*` â€“ documentation only

> [!important]
> If a hotfix must land on multiple branches, merge to the primary branch and **cherry-pick** into the relevant `release/*` branches.

---

## Code Style

* TypeScript with **strict** settings
* **ESLint (Flat Config)** + **Prettier** (with Tailwind plugin)
* **simple-import-sort** for import ordering
* Prefer clear, descriptive names and explicit types

```bash
# Lint
npm run lint

# Auto-fix
npm run lint:fix
```

---

## Testing

* Test runner: **Vitest v3**
* Example test layout:

  * `tests/unit-pure` â€“ pure logic
  * `tests/unit-dom` â€“ DOM behavior
  * `tests/unit-chrome` â€“ Chrome API (mocked)
  * `tests/integration` â€“ integration flows

```bash
# All tests
npm test

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

> [!note]
> For each feature/fix, please include **regression tests** and **behavioral tests** that capture the expected UX or messaging flow across **Panel â‡„ Content â‡„ Background**.

## Project Structure (Quick Reference)

* `src/runtime/panel/**` â€“ Side panel UI (selection list, capture actions, comment editing)
